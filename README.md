#### Features:

- **Variables** for custom opacity and colors
- Tab bar, URLBar and Sidebar **transparent**!
- **Keyboard** Centered Design!

### Installation:

1. In the searchbar type `about:config`
2. A dialog will be shown to you and press the `I accept the risk` button.
3. Search for **`toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`**, **`layers.acceleration.force-enabled`**, **`gfx.webrender.all`**, and **`svg.context-properties.content.enabled`**. Change them to **True**
4. Go to your Firefox profile located in `$HOME/.mozilla/firefox/XXXXXXX.default-release/`.
5. Create a folder and name it **`chrome`** (with lowercase) and then paste the `userChrome.css` and `userContent.css` (There's only one `userContent.css` ) files into it. 
6. (Optional) If you don't know if use a theme or not, you can use the Add-on theme I made for a better experience: [Add-on Theme](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/simplerentfox/)

### Some custom preferences:

- You can choose between both files `userChrome__NoURLBar` and `userChrome__WithURLBar` . Don't forget to delete the rest of the text in the title and just have `userChrome`! 

- You can check the sections in the `no-compressed` files and make the changes you want! 

- You can use the `compressed` files if you want a simpler experience (They also have **variables** so you can change the colors)

#### Your own colors and opacity:

In this section of the code you can change the colors, it's in RGBA so you can easily change the opacity and accent color, by default it's `#eaeaea`

#### A button you need doesn't show? You can easily add them again

In this section you can comment adding `/* */` around the button you want to show. 
  

### Shortcuts!
